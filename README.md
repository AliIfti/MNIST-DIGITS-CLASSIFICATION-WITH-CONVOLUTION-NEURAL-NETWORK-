# MNIST-DIGITS-CLASSIFICATION-WITH-CONVOLUTION-NEURAL-NETWORK
To build a model which can identify the MNIST digits by Recognition and classify them. 
Humans can see and visually sense the world around them by using their eyes and 
brains. Computer vision works on enabling computers to see and process images in the 
same way that human vision does. Several algorithms have developed in computer 
vision to recognize images. The goal of our work will be to create a model that will be 
able to identify and determine the MNIST digit from its image with better accuracy. Aim to 
complete this by using the concepts of Convolutional Neural Network. Through this work, 
aim to learn and practically apply the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks. 
Created our own data images of 1000 Images which are used to train and test. 
The issue of transcribed digit acknowledgment has for some time been an open issue in 
the field of example order. A few examinations have demonstrated that a Neural 
Network has an incredible execution in information arrangement. The fundamental target 
of this paper is to give effective and solid procedures to acknowledge transcribed 
numerical by looking at different existing arrangement models. This paper is about the 
exhibition of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Results demonstrate that CNN 
classifier beat over Neural Network with critical improved computational effectiveness 
without relinquishing execution. MNIST digit recognition can be performed using the 
Convolutional neural network from Machine Learning. Basically, to perform the model 
required some libraries such as NumPy, Pandas', TensorFlow, Keraâ€™s. 
This discussion is about the Convolutional Neural Network and its importance. It also 
covered how a dataset is divided into training and test dataset. A dataset was taken to 
make predictions of MNIST digits from 0 to 9. The dataset was cleaned, scaled, and 
shaped. Using TensorFlow, a CNN model was created and was eventually trained on 
the training dataset. Finally, predictions classification was made using the trained model 
with an accuracy of 98.6%.
